  { id: 1, title: "The Future of AI", content: "Today, I watched Lex Fridman's Podcast with Mark Zuckerberg titled 'Mark Zuckerberg: Future of AI at Meta, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp' and had to point out a few things. First, the biggest topic surrounding modern era is AI (Aritifical Intelligence). With Meta being one of the largest leaders in AI, Mark Zuckerberg opened up about his opinion behind Large Language Models or LLMs. Mark supported the release of an open source release of these models. My stance on this is that there should be some limitations and surveillance of this technology. The benefits of releasing an open source model is that people can use it and find ways to exploit it, which would allow for more security in the future. The downside is that if these exploits are large enough where there is little security, then the outcomes can be catastrophic.", image: mark, date: "September 16, 2023" },
